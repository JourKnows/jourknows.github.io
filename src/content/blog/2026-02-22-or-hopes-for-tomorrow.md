𝗟𝗜𝗧𝗘𝗥𝗔𝗥𝗬 | Hopes for Tomorrow

Another life taken away because of depression. As I sigh heavily each day, I wonder—when will it be my turn? Or will I be the next one?

Even though my life keeps pulling me into a dark dungeon filled with fear, pain and anxiety, I hold myself together so I will not break apart.

Sometimes, as I look upward with tears softly sliding down my cheeks, I ponder what tomorrow will hold. It feels like everything is slowly growing distant.

I long for a life where I no longer ask if the morning rays will touch me, like how the sun strikes everything with its orange and yellow light.

With my body full of dreadful thoughts, I worry that someday, I won’t be yawning with joy, like the birds that hum at dawn or reaching out my hands like the sky opening wide.

Even as I wake to a new morning and survive another day, my heart still trembles at the thought of what’s to come next. I cannot clearly see if I will breathe in hope, as the Earth breathes life.

Everything within me feels uncertain and cryptic. Will I ever run freely, like how the wind travels swiftly? I hope so.

Day by day, I pray that I will ignite like fire burning endlessly. I pray that the trust I have in myself will not fail me, and that it will overcome every temptation.

When everything becomes certain, will I flow with awe, like how water moves so freely? I will still admire how it weaves strong waves, and I will conquer them.

Someday, it will not be my turn. Still, this journey will not be easy. There will be times when I think of giving up, of ending everything, but like the cycle of morning and night, I will fight endlessly.

In the labyrinth of my mind, I promise myself, when I wish for tomorrow to glow like diamonds shimmering in the sky, I will be fine.

Lastly, darkness may lure, nor come near me, I will build a barrier of hopes that I will not let it swallow me. Like how sunrise chases the night away, I'll stand firm and seize everything tomorrow.
